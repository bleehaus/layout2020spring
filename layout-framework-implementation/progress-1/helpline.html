        <h2>The Helpline</h2>
        <h4>Our signature service is our LGBTQIA+ peer support helpline serving the Greater St. Louis area. Call in anytime on Friday - Sunday between 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM to access free, confidential, and identity-affirming peer support. Call in to process emotions, talk through resources, brainstorm ideas to assist a friend or loved one, or just to have a meaningful conversation. Whatever your needs, we are here to support, or we will connect you to someone who can.</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="disclaimer">
            <em>Disclaimer:</em> If you are having a medical or mental health emergency, please call someone you trust, 911, or one of these local or national hotlines FIRST. We still welcome your call AFTER you are in the process of receiving the immediate help that you need.<br><br>
            We are a short-term volunteer peer-counseling service. While we are guided by our Clinical Supervisors, we are no substitute for long-term, professional mental health care. Please visit MTUG's list of vetted providers or SQSHBook (once it launches in 2020) to contact a mental healthcare provider in the Greater St. Louis area.

                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Step 2: The volunteer will ask if you are in a safe place to talk.</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content"> If you are NOT in a safe place to talk:<br> The volunteer will work with you to explore options where you can talk with us most safely and comfortably.<br><br>If you ARE in a safe place to talk: <br>The volunteer will ask how they can address you.

                <div class="uk-accordion-content"> The volunteer will then ask what you would like to talk about today. Go ahead and share as much or as little as you’d like with them. We're here to listen.</div>

                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Step 4: After the call</a>

                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Operational Hours</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">Friday - Sunday 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM<br><br>
                We set our Helpline Hours on weekends because, outside of regular business hours, many folx lack access to mental health care and social support in school or work. If you had a bad week, or are just looking for someone in the LGBTQIA+ community to talk to over the weekend, call in!</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Highly Trained Volunteers</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">Before taking calls, all Peer Support Helpline Volunteers undergo 50+ hours of intense training and evaluations on an extensive range of issues that LGBTQIA+ callers may face. Active volunteers continue to train and refresh their skills throughout the year. Learn more about the volunteer curriculum here. </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Confidential</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">Volunteers will not disclose any information about a caller’s identity or situation. However, in situations where a caller is in immediate and severe danger, confidentiality may not be maintained. Read our Confidentiality & Privacy Policy here.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Single Session</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">Each call will be treated as a single session (i.e. not a continuing service with a case plan). Although volunteers undergo extensive, continual training, they are not qualified to provide ongoing counseling, and will thus provide referrals to outside resources if a caller requires ongoing mental health support. However, callers are welcome to use the Helpline more than once.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">No Intake Restrictions</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">SQSH will be a generally open service with no referrals required for access. Callers self-identify their need for service and are welcome to call with a variety of issues and situations. The Helpline is a resource for all LGBTQIA+ callers in St. Louis (and their family, friends, and allies), but we will not turn away any caller for not fitting this description. Other St. Louis service providers are also welcome to call on behalf of their LGBTQIA+ client(s).</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Vetted Resources</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                When making referrals and deciding which resources to include in our Resource Manual, we prioritize resources that are LGBTQIA-affirming, such as those that have been vetted by MTUG, Trans Education Service, PrideSTL, TransParent or PROMO, or that have been recommended to us by community members.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Updated Resources</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content"> We will continuously update our online Resource Manual (link here), and welcome related pamphlets and brochures to assist in making referrals for callers when needed.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Feedback Oriented</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">To continuously improve our service to the St. Louis LGBTQIA+ community, we always welcome feedback from Helpline users, and will regularly check our Feedback Forms to review input from Helpline users and community members.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Volunteer Community</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">We foster a tight-knit, supportive volunteer community to honor the principles of peer support within the SQSH community itself, reduce compassion fatigue, and minimize burnout. For every shift, at least two volunteers will be on call so that one can debrief, support, and switch roles with the other after a call. Volunteers may also earn practicum hours or academic credit. </div>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ul uk-accordion>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What does SQSH do?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">We provide free, confidential, and identity-affirming emotional support, resources, and referrals - For the St. Louis LGBTQIA+ community, by the community.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What do you mean by peer support?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">By peer support, we mean the identity-affirming, relational support that only peers who share similar experiences or identities are able to provide. The source of support is a peer, a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: they have "been there, done that" and can relate to others who are in a similar situation. </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What does the name "SQSH" mean?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                "SQSH" stands for St. Louis Queer+ Support Helpline. With the name "SQSH," we hope to convey the feeling of a hug to you, and subtly reference "squish" - the aromantic / asexual term for queer-platonic relationships. However, we acknowledge that the word "queer" can be a pejorative term for many members of our community, especially older adults, and a term that is filled with a history of hatred and pain. That history and experience is so valid. As such, we also commonly refer to our resource as simply, "the Helpline," and we welcome you to use whichever term you prefer.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Is SQSH mindful of the needs of QTPOC (Queer & Trans People of Color)?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">We know that the members of our community who face the most marginalization and least support are those of us holding multiple oppressed identities. We aim to be an intersectional resource; our volunteers strive to affirm, recognize and uplift all members of our community, especially QTPOC (queer and trans people of color), low-income, disabled, intersex, asexual / aromantic, non-binary folx and others who don't usually feel seen. Our logo intentionally includes not only rainbow colors, but also the colors of the trans flag (light blue, pink, white), and the colors of the QPOC-inclusive Pride Flag (brown, black). That being said, we always have a long way to go to undo the internalized oppression that we as volunteers have as members of this society. If you have any feedback at any point about the inclusiveness or effectiveness of our Helpline, we are always open to hearing it.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#"> If I don’t identify as LGBTQIA+ or queer, can I still call?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content"> Yes! Anyone of any sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression can call. </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What should I do if I know someone working on the Helpline and I don’t want to talk to them?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">There will always be two helpline volunteers working at the same time. If you call and know the volunteer who answers, you can always ask to talk to the other volunteer on shift. We prioritize your comfort level and would be happy to make the switch. </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How is SQSH funded?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">We started this project in 2019 using an initial $5,000 Civic Scholars grant from Washington University's Gephardt Institute for Civic & Community Engagement. Since then, we have been supported by the following major funding streams:
                <ul><li>$2,500 Mini Grant from St. Louis Violence Prevention Commission</li>
                <li>$1,900 from Facebook Fundraiser</li><li>$400 from Benefit Show by C U Next Tuesday</li>
                Going forward, we hope to sustain this project through local donations and grants. We spend our funds on training, printing resource manuals, food for volunteers, and liability insurance. We aim to publish quarterly or biannual expense reports to be fully transparent with how we spend our money. </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#"> Where is SQSH located?</a>
                <div class="uk-accordion-content">The Helpline is housed at a confidential location in order to protect the safety and privacy of our volunteers and callers. We thank you for understanding our unique needs as a LGBTQIA-specific helpline.</div>
            </li>

            <br>
             As members of the queer community, we have experienced firsthand the isolation, stigmatization, and fear that can arise from the lack of understanding and acceptance by the people around us. Many of us would have led different lives or made different decisions if we had a supportive, empathetic LGBTQIA+ peer to talk to when we were going through a hard time. That’s why we set up SQSH&mdash;a source of free, confidential, and identity-affirming peer support, by the St. Louis queer community, for the community.
