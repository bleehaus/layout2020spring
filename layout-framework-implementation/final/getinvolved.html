                <p>
                    Get involved in SQSH! We are a free, confidential, and identity-affirming peer support helpline service run by volunteers in the St. Louis LGBTQIA+ community, for the community. We work to serve and strengthen St. Louis - by providing an empathetic listening ear, by connecting callers safely and reliably to LGBTQIA-affirming resources, and by increasing the visibility of LGBTQIA+ concerns, needs, and resources in the St. Louis region.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe in deconstructing mainstream society's power structure and dynamics that perpetuate inequalities both within and outside of the LGBTQIA+ community. As such, we are a non-hierarchical organization that values mutual trust and every member's opinion. When you join SQSH's Project Team, you will gain equal say in SQSH's operations as everyone else on the Project Team.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Note:</em> All roles require availability on Saturday 10AM-12PM at least once a month.
